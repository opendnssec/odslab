# Setup a Secure Resolver using Unbound

The purpose of the lab is to setup the resolver on the first server. You should install *either* BIND or Unbound -- not both (unless uninstall BIND first).

1.  Connect to the server (resolverX.odslab.se) by using SSH or PuTTY.
2.  Change the host name.

        sudo hostname resolverX.odslab.se

3.  Login and logout to get an updated command prompt.
4.  Uninstall BIND if previously installed.

        sudo dpkg --purge bind9

5.  Install Unbound as the resolver. Also install dnsutils for dig(1).

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get upgrade
        sudo apt-get install unbound dnsutils

6.  Configure the Unbound not to use any forwarders

        sudo vim /etc/default/unbound

    File contents:

        RESOLVCONF_FORWARDERS=false

7.  Restart Unbound

        sudo systemctl restart unbound

8.  Verify by using dig. Notice that the AD-flag is set.

        dig +dnssec www.opendnssec.org

9.  Also try resolving a domain where DNSSEC is broken.

        dig www.trasigdnssec.se

    But we can see that in fact the domain does contain the information
    if we bypass the DNSSEC validation:

        dig +cd +dnssec www.trasigdnssec.se
